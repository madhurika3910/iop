    title: 'What is Ac Charging?',
    text: 'AC(Alternating current) charging is the most common charging method for electric vehicles with a plug. When plugging an electric vehicle into a normal charge point, the power gets converted inside the vehicle, then moves into the car battery. Charging speeds depend on the output power of the chargepoint as well as the convertor’s capabilities to convert the power to DC.',

    title: 'What is Dc Charging?',
    text: 'DC(Direct Current) charging can transform alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) itself, then it bypasses the onboard charger of an electric car and sends this current directly to the battery.',
